We were seated, we ordered, and the food came as soon as the rest of the patrons to this spot. This place filled up quickly for the dinner rush!The service was attentive, friendly, and quick. We ordered the:Veggie Momos which were filled with sautéed greens, cilantro, onions, carrots, and delicious herbs. The sauce was also delicious, and added a nice warmth and spice to the momos. Palak Paneer was creamy with a hint of herbs, and the paneer cubes were very rich and milky tasting. Machhako Tarkari Curry was a delicious salmon curry. It was a perfect compliment to the creamy palak planner, as it was a lighter more tomato based sauce. We also enjoyed that the entree dishes come with a side of rice and naan!For dessert we order Lal Mohan, yummy soft pudding like donut holes! They were so cute in the little bowl they came out in too. We will be back to this spot to try out their sizzling platters and other curries!'"

       "'I took my wife here for her birthday dinner, and we enjoyed everything we order. We arrive for an early meal at 5:45pm, and there was ample seating. We were seated, we ordered, and the food came as soon as the rest of the patrons to this spot. This place filled up quickly for the dinner rush!The service was attentive, friendly, and quick. We ordered the:Veggie Momos which were filled with sautéed greens, cilantro, onions, carrots, and delicious herbs. The sauce was also delicious, and added a nice warmth and spice to the momos. Palak Paneer was creamy with a hint of herbs, and the paneer cubes were very rich and milky tasting. Machhako Tarkari Curry was a delicious salmon curry. It was a perfect compliment to the creamy palak planner, as it was a lighter more tomato based sauce. We also enjoyed that the entree dishes come with a side of rice and naan!For dessert we order Lal Mohan, yummy soft pudding like donut holes! They were so cute in the little bowl they came out in too. We will be back to this spot to try out their sizzling platters and other curries!'"
